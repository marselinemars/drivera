The driving school management web application being developed aims to provide a comprehensive solution
to the challenges encountered during the driving school management process. The system will help the
driving school to effectively manage candidate (Driving School Student) information, scheduling,
payments, and communication. Additionally, the system will provide a user-friendly platform for driving
school owners and monitors to manage their operations efficiently and effectively. The intended audience
for this SRS document is the software development team responsible for designing, developing, and testing
the driving school management system. The document will provide a comprehensive guide to the system's
features and functionalities, as well as its requirements, constraints, and user interactions. The document
will also serve as a reference for software maintenance and updates. While the driving school owners and
monitors will be the primary users of the system, this document is not intended for them to use directly, but
rather to provide an understanding of the features and functionalities of the system being developed.
